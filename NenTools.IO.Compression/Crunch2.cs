// This is for custom version of crunch (https://github.com/BinomialLLC/crunch) by Unity:
// https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/crunch/tree/unity
// The game seems to use this version.

// All known tools seem to use this specific exe to handle the game's crunched textures https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/crunch/blob/unity/bin/crunch_x64.exe
// It has extra formats among with other breaking changes. Using the original crunch (self-compiled with latest or not) will not work (textures come out garbled).

// However compiling the unity branch from source doesn't quite seem to have all changes they made
// as it still seems to produce incorrect dds files when built.
// Furthermore crnd::crn_unpacker::unpack_level handles up to format 14 based on IDA research
// Which the source only goes up to 12?.. What happened here?

// Did unity never actually fully update the source or something?
// Many repos on github still seem to have the relevant new stuff (i.e cCRNFmtETC2AS)
// But I can't find anything from unity themselves. Besides, the executable, of course.

// What I think happened is that unity just, never publicly sourced ALL the changes, besides maybe privately (unity source?)
// Crunch2 seems to have all the changes (along with UABE2 and other unity related projects) - https://github.com/FrozenStormInteractive/Crunch2
// So we use that for now.

// I compiled crunch2 and added some extern "C" for C# bindings.
// Compiled as Release-X64 (Release), commit d5cd924754a1b39ea597335a979273ce71ef95a3.
